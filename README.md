SMART-POST

What are we going to make?
We want to develop a self-driving 'friendly' electric Smart car that can go to a specific location. With this car you do not need to go pick up mail yourself the car will take care of that for you. You will be able to track the location your mail at all times, and you will receive an estimated time of arrival for your mail.  

Why will you make it?
We want to solve the slow post system in Sweden and improve delivery times. 

How are you going to make it?
We are going to use Java in the mobile client side, c++ in the car side ie the arduino board and itâ€™s sensors to write code and GitHub to share the code the main functionalities we would like to include in our project are:
GPS tracking
integrated maps for path finding.
obstacles avoidance   
Autopilot
