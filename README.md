What: Program a car to deliver small light mail packages and envelopes.
The Rover/ smart car:
Will be functional inside buildings.
The car will have a small trolley on the back to put mails and packages inside to be delivered.
Will move on the hallway of a floor, stop at the door of the apartment that has a delivery and send a notification for pick up.
The App:
On your phone you will be able to track your delivery if you have one via the app. Get an estimated time of its arrival at your door and get notification once arrived for you to pick it up.
Features of the delivery man’s version/ Monitor:
Defining the apartments that got mail
Commanding to start or stop the delivery remotely
Features of the inhabitants/ Receiver version:
Get notification about the arrival of the mail
Confirmation of reception
Why: This period of the pandemic requires less human contact in order to avoid contamination. Besides the delivery man won't have to knock on each door to deliver the mails so you won't be embarrassed of picking up your mail wearing pyjamas. Besides, you won't have to open your mailbox each time to check if you got mail, you’ll be notified once you get one and have it delivered to you.

How: Java and C++ for programming, Github to share the code, Google drive to share all types of documents (word, presentations ...) and Trello for team and project management.
