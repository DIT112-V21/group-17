# SMART DeliRover


# What are we going to make?

We want to develop a self-driving 'friendly' electric Smart car that can go to a specific location. The car will be fnctional on the hallway of a floor of a building, With this car you wont need to go pick up mail yourself the car will take care of that for you and send you a notification when you have mail to pick and stops for you to pick up your mail when it reaches your door . You will be able to track the location of your mail at all times, and you will receive an estimated time of its arrival.  

# Why will you make it?

Sometimes we just feel like going picking up the mail wearing pyjamas and don't want to be seen so :D, moreover it will facilitate for the mail man the work so he/she will will just have to move from floor to floor not from door to door than cars in each floor will move in parallel. 

# How are you going to make it?

We are going to use Java in the mobile client side, c++ in the car side ie the arduino board and it’s sensors to write code and GitHub to share the code the main functionalities we would like to include in our project are:
Coordinates tracking
obstacles avoidance   
Autopilot
