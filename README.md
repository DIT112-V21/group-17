## 💡 What is Smart DeliRover

Smart DeliRover App is an android app to monitor 'friendly' electric Smart car that can go to deliver mails and interact with the receiver about the delivery via messages. The car is functional on the hallways of a floor of a building. With this car you wont need to go pick up mail yourself the car will take care of that for you 😎. When the car  reaches your door  you will get a 📧 notification to pick up your mail. We implemented two versions of the app: one for the mailman to monitor the car, check receivers info and send messages,and the other one for the receiver to br notified about his/her delivery.

***The main functionalities included in our project are:***
> * Control the car manually through the app
> * View the list containing information about the receivers
> * Notify the receivers to expect a delivery
> * Notify the receivers to pick up their mail
> * Checking messages
> * Notify the mailman of the availability of receivers to pickup the mail or not
> * Obstacles avoidance 

## 🤔 Why did we make it

This period of the pandemic requires less human contact in order to avoid contamination. And Sometimes we just don't feel like going out pick up the mail wearing pyjamas and don't want to be seen so 😜. Moreover it will facilitate for the mailman the work so he/she will just have to move from floor to floor not from door to door than the car takes it over. 

## 🛠 How did we make it

The App itself is an android mobile app, developed using Android Studio. The code is written in Java language. The car is functional int he emulator. Both the car and the app connect to the broker in order for the user to monitor the car via the Smart DeliRover app.
We used the Arduino IDE to programme the car using c++ laguage.
We used GitHub be able to contribut in the development of the project as a group and to trace our contributions. Furthermore, to document the project. Especially that team members just meet vertually. Yep! we don't even know eachother's faces 🙄 (The bright side! we codedd wearing Pajamas! 😎)
